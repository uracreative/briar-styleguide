                <p>Our personality establishes the foundation of the Briar brand. It is a product of our mission, and a reflection of our culture, values, and promise to customers. We make sure that these traits come through in all of our customer-facing communications and content.
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Bold</b> <br />We take a stand. Not everyone will agree with everything we say – and that's ok. We state our position and back it up. We are clear and direct, acknowledge the hard truths… but are not cocky. We have our point of view, but don’t belittle our competitors or people who don't share it. We are humble. We know we’re a team that makes awesome software, but we're balanced. We acknowledge when we fail, admit it, embrace it, and grow from it.</li><br />
                  <li><b>Optimistic</b> <br/ >We are upbeat, resourceful, and friendly. We motivate and demonstrate a can-do attitude to show what good things are possible. We know that innovating and getting things done is messy, we acknowledge that, and then focus on the solutions together. We are not delusional. We know that we make sophisticated, and at times complicated tools that take a little time to master. So we don't over-promise when it comes to the learning curve. We strive to simplify the path and explain the best way forward. We make people more productive and less stressed. We can't solve every problem a team has, but we empathize and give it our best shot.</li><br />
                  <li><b>Practical with a wink</b> <br/ >We lend a helping hand. Tips, tricks, and how-tos are gold. We provide the right information at the right time. Having "just enough" is better than "all the things”. We use clear, plain-spoken language, avoid industry jargon, and are mindful of using references that may confuse people of different cultures. We don't take ourselves too seriously. We know humor makes life more enjoyable. We are free to be funny, but we don't force it. It's more about being "human" than being "humorous." We’ll poke fun at ourselves, and are never crude. If it would make our 13-year-old cousin snicker, we make a better choice (unless it’s a really bad pun).</li>
